### LFD_MPIV_Toolbox v2.0

## Description
LFD_MPIV_Toolbox is a Matlab (R) Toolbox aimed at obtaining tomographic - phase
averaged PIV fields from Hamamatsu CXD files. The application for which it is
developed is micro fluidic (imaging through inverted microscope) and thus some
default choice reflect that. This toolbox is heavily inspired by (and some files
are portion of) the PIVlab Toolbox (http://pivlab.blogspot.com/), which might be
a better choice as a generic solution for PIV.

This work has been funded through the CONICET grant PIP 112 201501 00243 CO.
This work has been realized at the Nano and Microfluidic Laboraory of the Universidad de la Marina Mercante, Buenos Aires Argentina.

## Features
The main features that commended the development of this package over the use
of PIVlab are:

- Support of CXD files (for the moment, the only format accepted).

- Phase reconstruction using frequencies or matlab files with time stamps for
  actuation and acquisition.

- Cumulative cross-correlation for phase averaging.

- Most options supported in PIVlab are supported here.

## Installation

- clone or download and unzip the repository

- add path of LFD_MPIV_TOOLBOX to MATLAB path

- LFD_MPIV_Interface or LFD_MPIV_CommandLine('my_cxd_file.cxd')
